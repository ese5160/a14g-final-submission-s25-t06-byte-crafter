### 2.1 Device Description

Our device is a smart fingerprint-based door lock that enhances home security using both local authentication and cloud-based controls.

We were inspired by the need for smarter and safer access control, especially in shared living spaces or areas prone to tailgating or forced entry. The device solves the problem of insecure manual locks by providing biometric authentication, emergency alerts, and cloud-controlled access management.

The Internet enables remote unlocking and real-time warning messages via the cloud when a duress fingerprint is used. It also allows the cloud to approve or reject local requests to add or delete fingerprints and to send alerts if the built-in IMU detects physical tampering.
