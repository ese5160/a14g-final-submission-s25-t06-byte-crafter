<h2 id="2-project-summary">2. Project Summary</h2>
<h3>2.1 Device Description</h3>
  <p>
  Our device is a smart fingerprint-based door lock that enhances home security using both local authentication and cloud-based controls.
  </p>
  <p>
  We were inspired by the need for smarter and safer access control, especially in situations where traditional locks are vulnerable to tailgating, coercion, or physical tampering.
  Our device addresses this by using fingerprint-based authentication, with each user registering both a normal and a duress fingerprint—the latter silently triggers an emergency alert in the cloud.
  Internet connectivity augments the system with remote unlock and fingerprint management functionality, while a built-in IMU detects tampering attempts and triggers a local alarm for immediate response.
  </p>
    
<h3>2.2 Device Functionality</h3>

<p>
  The core of our internet-connected smart lock system is built around the SAMW25 microcontroller, which integrates Wi-Fi connectivity and manages interactions between local components and the cloud. This device combines biometric authentication, real-time security feedback, and remote access capabilities to deliver both convenience and safety.
</p>

<p><strong>Authentication and Access Control:</strong><br>
The system uses a <strong>fingerprint module</strong> to distinguish between normal and duress fingerprints. A normal fingerprint grants access and actuates the lock, while a duress fingerprint silently triggers an emergency alert in the cloud. Access can also be controlled remotely through cloud-issued unlock command.
</p>

<p><strong>Sensors and Alerts:</strong><br>
An onboard <strong>IMU</strong> monitors for vibrations or forced movements of the lock. If tampering is detected—such as an attempt to pry open the device—a local <strong>buzzer</strong> is activated to alert nearby occupants.
</p>

<p><strong>Actuators and Mechanism:</strong><br>
The locking mechanism is simulated using a <strong>servo motor</strong> to represent door opening and closing. This allows for reliable and observable movement in our prototype without requiring a physical lock pin.
</p>

<p><strong>User Interface:</strong><br>
A <strong>rotary encoder</strong> and <strong>LCD</strong> screen form the local interface. Users can navigate menus to view, register or delete fingerprints. All add/delete actions must be approved by the cloud to prevent unauthorized changes.
</p>

<p><strong>Internet-Enhanced Features:</strong><br>
The device connects to the internet to support remote door unlocking, allowing users to control access even when they are not physically present.
</p>

<p>To aid in understanding the overall structure and flow of the system, a system-level block diagram is included below, illustrating the interactions among the microcontroller, sensors, actuators, and network interface.</p>

<h3>2.3 Challenges</h3>

<p>
  One of our main challenges was hardware-related. Due to manufacturing issues, we ended up with only a single functional customized PCBA, which created both logistical and psychological pressure since our team had two members.
  Moreover, the SAMW25 chip’s pin assignments conflicted with our PCB layout, so we had to carefully plan our peripheral configurations—reusing the same SERCOM and TCC/TC-compatible pins whenever possible.
  This allowed us to streamline code portability from the development board to the custom hardware.
</p>

<p>
  A more complex challenge emerged during system integration.
  After completing the individual modules for sensors and actuators, we encountered pin conflicts—specifically, both the buzzer and servo motor were initially assigned to TCC0, but they required different PWM frequencies.
  Since reinitializing the PWM mid-operation didn’t work reliably, we had to fully reset TCC0 before switching between them.
  Additionally, although the datasheet showed that pins PA04 and PA05 supported both TCC0 and TCC3, the ASF Start tool did not offer TCC3 as a selectable option, limiting our flexibility.
</p>

<p>
  An even deeper issue came from managing multiple communication interfaces: UART, SPI (with DMA), and I2C.
  While the DMA SPI-based communication with the Wi-Fi module was relatively stable, UART and I2C transmissions were frequently interrupted by Wi-Fi activity—causing missed or corrupted data.
  Combined with instability in our specific Wi-Fi chip version, this made integration and communication timing especially difficult.
  We addressed this by carefully tuning task priorities and inserting well-calculated task delays to maintain system responsiveness and data integrity.
</p>


<h3>2.4 Prototype Learning</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the development of our prototype, we realized the importance of thoroughly verifying hardware peripheral support—not just from the datasheet, but also from the actual development tools and software libraries.
  Early in the project, we assigned both the buzzer and servo motor to TCC0, thinking we could later move one to TCC3 based on the datasheet’s claim that PA04 and PA05 support TCC3.
  However, we later discovered that TCC3 wasn't actually supported in the ASF4 configuration tools, which forced us to manage both PWM outputs under TCC0.
  This made the code more complex, as switching between the two required a full reset of the timer.
  In hindsight, using two distinct timers from the start (e.g., TCC0 and TC3) would have significantly simplified our implementation.
</p>

<p>
  If we were to build this device again, we would explore using DMA-based UART communication instead of interrupt-driven or polling-based methods.
  Since UART transmissions were frequently interrupted by Wi-Fi activity, using DMA could offload the CPU, reduce latency, and improve communication reliability during periods of high system activity.
  These changes would simplify code structure, improve system robustness, and make integration more efficient.
</p>

<h3>2.5 Next Steps & Takeaways</h3>
<p>
  There are two main areas for future improvement.
  First, while the current implementation displays a warning message in the cloud when a duress fingerprint is used,
  a more advanced version could trigger automatic emergency responses—such as notifying pre-assigned contacts or even calling for help.
  Second, the current prototype uses a servo motor to simulate the lock mechanism; to deploy this system in real-world environments,
  the mechanism could be upgraded to control an actual door lock, which would require mechanical redesign and integration with commercial lock hardware.
</p>

<p>
  ESE5160 offered an in-depth learning experience that combined embedded software development with hardware design and system integration.
  Through the lectures, we gained practical skills in FreeRTOS-based real-time programming, including task creation, priority management, and inter-task synchronization using semaphores and mutexes.
  These concepts were reinforced through lab assignments and ultimately applied in our final project.
  We also learned how to work with complex communication stacks like UART, I2C, and SPI alongside Wi-Fi,
  gaining insight into how real-world systems must balance concurrency and timing.
  Additionally, the course introduced us to PCB design using Altium Designer,
  where we created schematics, laid out custom PCBA, and generated manufacturing-ready files.
  This hands-on experience bridged the gap between theory and practice and prepared us for real-world embedded system development.
